# LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) from Scratch for Sentiment Analysis

## Details

- Used `distilbert-base-uncased` as the base model.
- The `LoRA` pipeline was entirely build from scratch replicating the architecture included in their original  __[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)__.
- Tested on the `imdb` dataset from `huggingface` for sentiment analysis:
    - Validation accuracy on the original base model: `~50%`
    - Validation accuracy after applying LoRA: `91.4%` (3 epochs)
